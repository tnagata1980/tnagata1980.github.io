  <div class="profile-txt">
    <p>I have worked in the design industry for twenty years now. I have long had a fascination with the
philosophy of design and how deeply it penetrates our daily lives, consciously or unconsciously. This
has impacted me greatly and, as a designer myself, I have dedicated a lot of my time to its study. My
career in this field has so far seen me amass experience from working within three very different
companies.</p>
