    <p>I spent four years working at Vistaprint which enjoys the number one market share for online printing in The USA. I was an original member of their startup team tasked with launching their Japan branch in 2015. I was the sole creative employee able to speak English and was consequently dispatched to Boston to learn more about their technology. I disseminated that knowledge upon my return so that it could be applied to our Japan office. I was later promoted to the role of Creative Manager which placed me within the wider Leadership team. I gained a wealth of experience during my time there, not only in terms of my graphic design work but also with respect to business logistics.</p>

  <p>I spent nine years here working as a graphic designer. Our main client was Benesse Corporation which is preeminent in its field of developing child education tools, including correspondence courses and exams. I also worked on magazines, fashion marketing tools, CI, and more. I began my time here acquiring skills from the basis of graphic design. By the time I left the company I had become more analytical about what distinguishes an operator from a designer.</p>

    <p>I began my design career here. This was an editorial design studio which was an extremely fast paced working environment to be in. The work was often intense. I learned from scratch how to use a Mac and all of its available tools for professional use. I was very quickly promoted in recognition of my hard work and rapidly developing aptitude. During my final year there I was assigned sole responsibility for the design direction of several magazines and this helped increase my confidence as a designer.</p>
