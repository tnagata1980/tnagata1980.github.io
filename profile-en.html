    <p>I worked for 4 years at Vistaprint which is the no.1 share online printing company in the USA. I was one of the start up members for their Japan branch launched in 2015. I was the only one creative employee who could speak English and I flied to Boston to learn their technology to localise to Japan. The final year I was in charge of a Creative Manager and a member of the Leadership team. I experienced a lot of things especially the business side that beyond  just being as a Graphic designer.</p>

The main client was Benesse Corporation which is the biggest company of child education, also I worked on magazines, fashion marketing tools, CI and more. I started learning from the basis of Graphic design and ended to clear myself to think about the deferences between just being an operator and being a designer.</p>

    <p>I started my design career from here. It was an Editorial design studio and my days past so quickly because of the hard work. I learned from the scratch of how to use Mac as a professional, and what the joy was I was promoted very quickly which means I felt they treated me equally as employees who worked for long time, even I was a new. The final year I was in charge of design direction of several magazines and that helped me to be a confident designer.</p>
