  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>First and foremost, my aim is to promote a harmonious working relationship with people. My attitude towards others is therefore open and friendly. I believe that this is the essence of achieving successful communication within and across teams. I consider myself to be a team player and will always work hard alongside others to reach goals that have been set. I love working with people and I strive to create a fun environment to work in. I encourage others and motivate them to always perform to their very best ability. Even when faced with challenging circumstances I try hard not to let go of my positivity. My motto at work is " Start with fun. Finish with fun."</p>

  </div>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>"We shirt" was a web service product which targeted younger customers. The facility enabled people to create team t-shirts simply by using their smart phone. We worked in coordination with a creative agency (KAYAC) and I was tasked with ensuring that we were always perfectly aligned on the visual side. I was responsible for all the visuals of the marketing tools as well as the branding direction. I was fully involved in the marketing planning from its outset through to the final event setting, which was a qualified success. We were confronted with a number of difficulties along the way but, happily, we managed to overcome them through strong teamwork and effective problem solving. My memory of this project is one I value greatly, in part because it firmly cemented my love of working within a team. </p>

    <p>For the duration of my final year there, I was put in charge of the creative team in my official role as assistant manager at Cimpress. My point of focus was to nurture each designer’s skills development and to increase their confidence. In my experience, designers can sometimes be reticent when asked to express their thoughts and opinions in a business setting. This is because the business arm can often be dominated by logical people who have no appreciation of the creative design process. With this in mind, my approach was to understand the individual character and nature of each team member. By talking to them directly and getting to know them better I was able to help increase their self-confidence. It was immensely rewarding to see each of them gradually become more independent
    and self-assured. Ultimately, this benefited the team as a whole and I gained more confidence myself as a result.</p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>This is a private project of mine. I had long been thinking about what kind of service would be of genuine help to people, particularly considering that everyone nowadays seems to have everything they need. The idea of a web service for foreign tourists visiting Japan eventually came to me. However, I approached this from a different direction focusing on lesser known places of interest as opposed to the more established and famous sightseeing spots and retail stores listed elsewhere. This also doubles as a test project to better understand how web marketing works with SNS.</p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>Another private project of mine. The initial idea for this was borne out of my frustration that so many amateur artists with real talent exist but lack the public exposure they deserve. I decided to give them that exposure by creating a free magazine in which their work would appear. I didn’t charge a fee for publishing their work and over an extended period I received a lot of interest from various artists. I ended up publishing sixteen monthly editions. It was a great project to work on and it helped connect me with a lot of interesting people.</p>
