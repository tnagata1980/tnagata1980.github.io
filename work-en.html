  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>My work style is friendly to people. I think it is the most important essence of communication. I create fun in work, encourage team members and let them be perform their best. I love working in a team, love to achieve goals with people. I try very hard to keep the team work and motivate them, as one on one. Even though in the difficult situation I try not to loose the positivity. My motto is " Start with fun, finish with fun."</p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>"We shirt" was a web service project which was aimed at young customers to encourage creating team T-shirts with friends on their smart phone. We worked with a Creative agency (KAYAC) and I helped keep the same direction in the visual side between ourself and KAYAC. I was in charge of all of the visual of marketing tools and branding direction. I experienced from marketing planing to actual event setting which was a successful moment. We faced a lot of serious moments but everything is unchangeable memories. My love of teamworking probably rooted in this project. </p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>About one year, I was in charge of manage the creative team as an assistant manager at Cimpress. My focus point was let each designers be confident. In my opinion Designers tend to be disadvantage of speak up their thoughts in the business situation because there are full of logical people. My method is understanding each character through to direct communication and let them be confident in their ways. Each members became independent in a good way in the end and it made me confident as well.</p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>Private project. I had been thinking what kind of service would be genuinely helpful to people, even though in the time like this that we have everything. Then last year the idea of web service for tourists in Tokyo to introduce place where actually Japanese people go, lather than the famous spots in the guidebook. Also it is my test project to understand how the web marketing does work with SNS.</p>

  <div class="work-txt">
    <p>Private project. The initial idea came from my frustration of the fact that there are so many amateur artists who have talent but no chance to express themselves in public because of no way to do that. I wanted to create the opportunity  for it and I created a free magazine of the artists. It was no charge for artists so many of them contacted me, I published every month, for 16 issues. It was a very good project to connect many interesting people.</p>
