  <div class="about-txt">
    <p>I love traveling. Especially London is my second hometown. My way to enjoy the trip is watching daily life of local people, and experience days like local people. I go to museums, bookstores, markets lather than the tourist spots. My most precious time is just wandering around the city, and let everything happen naturally.</p>

  <h1 class="title">UK</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-txt">
  <p>I love the UK and I think my mum inspired me. She always said "Every good music and design created in the UK" and I agreed with it. According to my experience of studying in London, I feel more like home when I walk in there. I love the attitude they say "Are you alright? Tea?" when people get upset, it helped me think easy. They do not be nosy and keep a particular distance between people as the culture, I think it because they value realistic and independence to be mature and clever which is my thing.</p>

<h1 class="title">thinking</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-txt">
<p>Thinking is my hobby. I like think from the bottom of things to have a big picture. Everyday my head is full of curiosity and never be board. The things which I into it at the moment are "Theory of Time" and "Architectural thinking".</p>

<h1 class="title">reading</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-txt">
<p>I love books. From Art book to novels. I always fascinated the power of reading that the text shows you visions and sounds in your head when you read it. I love turning pages and feeling of paper, so I think I will never reach to digital books.</p>

<div class="about-img">

<h1 class="title">design</h1>
</div>

<div class="about-txt">
<p>I remember I wanted to be a baker when I was a child, but when I decided to be a designer at 11 years old, I never had another dream. My parents worked in creative area and it inspired me, but also I was impressed that there is a job to create meaning with colours and strokes on papers to communicate people. Year by year I learn something new on design, never last study. I want to be an architect or a professional Japanese sweets maker in a hypothetical life, but I would say my decision of becoming a designer was one of the best choices in my life.</p>
